# Cashier

This code is developed to satisfy the requirements of a test.

It represents a cashier system where items can be scanned and added to a basket and get the total price with discounts at checkout.

## Usage

Run `bin/cashier` and the results of the requested requirements will be presented on screen.

## Presenter (optional)

An extra branch was created to give a bit of presentation when returning the expected values. This branch is not needed to run the app.
